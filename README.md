There are total 6 actions.
1. Create object of particular class with a name. Eg: A adam
2. Delete object of given name. Eg: A
3. Invoke execute with args for a given class. Eg: adam a=1 b=2 apple='banana'
4. Print number of executes of given object name. Eg: adam
5. Print number of executes of a class. Eg: C
6. Quit

Select the action and give inputs as in the examples mentioned. It is robust and covers much error scenarios.

Try it :)
